Either you are in the 'Yes I will figure this out business' or 'No this won’t work because….' Too many of you are stuck, fucking stuck in 'this is not going to work because…' You’re still bitter, you’re upset, you’re still upset that girl broke up with you. That’s why it’s not happening. You’re upset that your parents didn’t have any money, an you have to pay for it yourself. You’re upset. And you’re in the this 'I can’t have this work out because you actually got upset that the number was 18 hours a day, instead of realizing that’s not what I fucking gave a fuck about. It’s maximizing what you can do while you’re awake. Whether you’re sleeping 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hours that’s fine. I’m just interesting in the 14, 15, 16 hours you have to do something about it. But what I’m more interested in is why do you have so much poison in you...

        <p>"If you want to achieve what you want to achieve at the highest level this is a binary game. Either you are in the “Yes I will figure this out business” or “No this won’t work because…”. Too many of you are stuck, fucking stuck in “this is not going to work because…” You’re still bitter, you’re upset, you’re still upset that girl broke up with you. That’s why it’s not happening.

But what I’m more interested in is why do you have so much poison in you, why do you have so much negativity in you, why are you loosing. Why is that your mindset?''
