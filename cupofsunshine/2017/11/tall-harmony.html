    <meta itemprop="description" content="I don’t focus so much on happiness as I do harmony. I don’t believe in the word balance because balance is a binary thing. Harmony is saying my life has many components. I’m a woman, I’m a mom, I’m sexual, I’m spiritual, I’m a business person. All of those limbs have to have tone. And that brings about harmony. That brings about satisfaction. If we only had one limb that was very buff and the rest of us was atrophied, that brings about disharmony and dissatisfaction.
