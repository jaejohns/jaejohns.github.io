    <meta itemprop="description" content="Attitude is the most important choice any of us will make. We made it yesterday and we get another choice to make it today. And then again tomorrow.
    The choice to participate. To be optimistic. To intentionally bring out the best in other people. We make the choice to inquire, to be curious, to challenge the status quo. To give people the benefit of the doubt. To find hope instead of fear in the face of uncertainty. Of course these are attitudes. What else could they be? And of course, they are a choice. No one does these things to us. We choose them and do the work (and find the benefits) that come with them. Seth Godin Quote">
