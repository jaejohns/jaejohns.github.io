    <meta itemprop="description" content="Thousand years ago most people believed the world was flat (actually there are some people still believing that in 2016). To believe otherwise was considered insanity. People were afraid to push their boundaries beyond their own horizons because of the fear of falling off the edge.
    But there were pioneers who had utter faith that the world was round; intrepid explorers who paved the way for a new way of thinking and proved that not only the world was round but that there were new vast continents out there with riches beyond the imagination.
    These pioneers are present in our own lives too. Those that show us a way. Those that allow us to believe in the possibilities.
    Seek out those who have done what you want to achieve. Adopt them as your unofficial mentor. Watch how they operate in the world and allow that to shape your journey.
