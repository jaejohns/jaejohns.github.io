        <h3>Tall Glass of Inspiration</h3>
        <h2>The Harland Before Time</h2>
        <p>Amy Purdy gave a TED talk. This is how she transformed her life.<br><br>
        Over the course of two and a half months I lost my spleen, my kidneys, the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee. When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital I felt like I had been pieced back together like a patchwork doll. I thought the worst was over until weeks later when I saw my new legs for the first time. The calves were bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot with the raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle to look like a vein. I didn’t know what to expect but I wasn’t expecting that.<br><br>
        With my mum by my side and tears streaming down our faces, I strapped on these chunky legs and I stood up. They were so painful and so confining that all I could think was how am I ever going to travel the world in these things? How was I ever going to live the life full of adventures and stories as I always wanted? And how was I going to snowboard again?<br><br>
        That day, I went home, I crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months. Me passed out, escaping from reality with my legs resting by my side. I was absolutely, physically and emotionally broken. But I knew that in order to move forward, I had to let go of the old Amy and learn to embrace the new Amy. And that is when it dawned on me that I didn’t have to be 5.5 ft. anymore. I could be as tall as I wanted. Or as short as I wanted depending on who I was dating.<br><br>
        And if I snowboarded again, my feet aren’t going to get cold. And best of all, I thought I can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales rack and I did. So there were benefits here.
