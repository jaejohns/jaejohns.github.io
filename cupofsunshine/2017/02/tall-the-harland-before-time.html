        <h3>Tall Glass of Inspiration</h3>
        <h2>The Harland Before Time</h2>
        <p>By age 65 Colonel Harland Sanders felt like a failure and decided he was going to commit suicide. He sat writing his will, but instead, he wrote what he would have accomplished with his life. He then borrowed $87 and went door to door selling chicken. It took more than 1,000 attempts before he was able to convince people to franchise his fried chicken concept. <br><br>

                                  Today KFC is valued at over a billion dollars.</p>
