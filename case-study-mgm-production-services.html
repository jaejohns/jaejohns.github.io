          <h3>How the Goal was Achieved</h3>
          <ul>

              <li>- Incorporated their gorgeous photography from past events as main header images throughout all the pages and as smaller thumbnail images that linked to other pages.</li>
              <li>- Incorporated their green brand color and brand font </li>
              <li>- Vegas is extremely active at night and the dark color scheme is used to subtly symbolize this</li>
              <li>- Featured dedicated image galleries and video galleries to really show the team’s talent in producing top notch events. </li>
