          <p>I’m very much looking forward to hearing about your project! Before you invest your time filling out this questionnaire, I want to provide a brief insight into my <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold" href="case-study-mgm-production-services.html">approach</a> and what kind of projects I take on, so you can determine if this will be a worthwhile effort for you.</p>

          <p>There is no budget field on this form, nor do I display any rates. In our preliminary discussion, I want us to concentrate on the project goals and what will enable excellent results. I do extremely good work, so that’s what I focus on-meaning that what I charge is not meant in any way to be competitive.</p>

          <p>I’m selective about the clients I take on. If your budget is minimal, we won’t be a good fit. If you don’t know whether your budget is minimal or not, we probably won’t be a good fit.</p>

          <p>If your focus is on having someone with experience dedicate themselves towards crafting something that will be effective for your needs, and that is something you’re willing to invest in, we will likely be an excellent fit.</p>
