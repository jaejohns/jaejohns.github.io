              <p>I <strong>showed up everyday</strong> and posted content at <strong>least every week</strong>. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The topics I covered were from “How to find anime DVDs at great prices”, “Where to go to get subtitled animes in French”, “Where to go to get subtitled animes in Korean”, “Where to buy cheap anime toys”, etc. </li>
                <li>I did this for three years
                    <ul>
                      <li>I didn't get fixated on the amount of likes, subscriberes or followers</li>
                      <li>Any likes, followers or subscribers I got in this three years I thought of purely as a bonus. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When starting this I didn’t have three years of topics to cover, but I as I continued to do this I got more ideas.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Also the years went by, people who commented on my content suggested some ideas. As more and more people requested the same topic, I knew that topic was in high demand.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>After spending years building trust, <strong>my name became a brand that people can rely on</strong>. This allowed me to develop a community that people would be attracted to.  </li>
                  <li>The Community was going to be either free or paid for.
                    <ul><li>Pro - Free means anybody could access it, it would potentially help more people</li>
                    <li>Con - Free means there will be trolls and people who potentially abuse it</li>
                    <li>Pro - Paid means we create a barrier to access which will prevent trolls from coming in</li>
                    <li>Con - Paid means it can only help a selective group of people</li>
